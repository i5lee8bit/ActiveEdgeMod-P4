# ActiveEdgeMod-P4
UNOFFICIAL continuation of Active Edge Magisk module by j to the 4n

Created and shared with permission from the original developer.
Please DO NOT contact j to the 4n for any support; this is an
UNOFFICIAL continuation of the Active Edge Magisk mod, only for
the phones that my wife and I own (Pixel 4 "FLAME" and Pixel 4
XL "CORAL").

We are long time HTC users, and having advanced squeezing
functionality was a big reason for our decision to purchase
these particular phones. Thus, it was important for me to
continue to have this functionality on our devices. With
permission from j to the 4n, I am continuing to modify the
SystemUIGoogle.apk file with the necessary modifications.

Huge thanks to j to the 4n, for all his contributions and work
for the development community in general! What a legend!
