# ActiveEdgeMod-P4
UNOFFICIAL continuation of Active Edge Magisk module by j to the 4n

Created and shared with permission from the original developer.
Please DO NOT contact j to the 4n for any support; this is an
UNOFFICIAL continuation of the Active Edge Magisk mod, only for
the phones that my wife and I own (Pixel 4 "FLAME" and Pixel 4
XL "CORAL") - **NOTE: RELEASED FOR 3 AND 3A SERIES NOW.

We are long time HTC users, and having advanced squeezing
functionality was a big reason for our decision to purchase
these particular phones. Thus, it was important for me to
continue to have this functionality on our devices. With
permission from j to the 4n, I am continuing to modify the
SystemUIGoogle.apk file with the necessary modifications.

Huge thanks to j to the 4n, for all his contributions and work
for the development community in general! What a legend!

--NOTE--: The modified files are the same for Pixel 3 and 3a series,
so I went ahead and modded them as well. I don't own these
devices, so please use at your own risk. I likely won't be able
to help if you have any issues either.

**PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT ME TO UPDATE THESE AS QUICKLY / PROMPTLY
AS THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPER! THIS IS JUST A LITTLE PROJECT I'M DOING
ON THE SIDE FOR FUN / EXPERIENCE, AND ALSO JUST AS A BIG FAN OF THE
ORIGINAL DEVELOPER'S WORK. I'M NOT RECEIVING ANY COMPENSATION FOR
IT - I JUST REALLY LOVE THE MOD AND WANTED TO KEEP IT ALIVE.
